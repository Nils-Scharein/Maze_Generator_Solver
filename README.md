# Maze_Generator_Solver

This is a practice project in **C++**, originally created to experimentally explore the graphics library **[SFML 2.6.1](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)**.

## Project Goal

The goal was to learn and implement basic mechanisms for displaying and controlling graphical objects using SFML — especially with regard to simple game or simulation logic (e.g., maze or grid systems).

> ❌ **This project has been discontinued.**

Development on this project has been stopped in favor of a more comprehensive and structured implementation using **Qt**.

## Successor Project

The further development of this concept — including a user-friendly interface and better maintainability — can be found in the project:
